# 🛠️ ESRORD Toolbox: Real-Time Scheduling Simulator V1.01

Welcome to the **ESRORD Toolbox**, a powerful tool designed for simulating and analyzing real-time task scheduling algorithms within the MATLAB environment.

---

## Getting Started

There are two primary ways to run the ESRORD Toolbox: **Installation** (for permanent use) and **Portable Execution** (for quick, non-permanent use).

### 1. Installation Method (Recommended)

This method integrates the toolbox directly into your MATLAB environment, making it callable from any directory.

1.  **Installation:**
    * Open **MATLAB**.
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved the ESRORD Toolbox file (e.g., the `.mlappinstall` or compressed file).
    * Double-click the installation file or use the MATLAB command window to install it following the standard MATLAB procedures.

2.  **Launching the Toolbox:**
    * Once installed, you can launch the toolbox from **anywhere** within MATLAB by typing the following command in the **Command Window**:
        ```
        esrord
        ```

3.  **Initial Setup (GUI):**
    * A graphical user interface (GUI) will appear.
    * In the GUI, select the desired scheduling **Technique (Ordonnanceur)**, such as **Round Robin**, **Rate Monotonic (RM)**, or others available options.
    * Enter the **Number of Tasks** you wish to simulate.

4.  **Configuration (Command Line):**
    * After the initial setup in the GUI, you must complete the parameter entry in the **MATLAB Command Window**.
    * The GUI will prompt you or the toolbox will wait for your input to specify the remaining task parameters (e.g., execution times, periods, deadlines) as required by the chosen scheduling algorithm.
    * *Follow the on-screen instructions that appear in the Command Window to finalize your simulation setup.*

### 2. Portable Execution Method

This method allows you to run the application directly from its main folder without a formal installation.

1.  **Accessing the Folder:**
    * Open **MATLAB**.
    * Navigate to the main directory of the portable toolbox:
        ```
        /path/to/ordonnanceur/esrord toolbox/
        ```
        (Make sure this directory is the current folder in your MATLAB session).

2.  **Launching the Toolbox:**
    * In the **MATLAB Command Window**, run the main application file:
        ```
        esrord.fig
        ```
    * *Note: This file contains the main graphical interface and will launch the application.*

3.  **Initial Setup (GUI):**
    * The GUI will appear.
    * In the GUI, select the desired scheduling **Technique (Ordonnanceur)**, such as **Round Robin**, **Rate Monotonic (RM)**, or others available options.
    * Enter the **Number of Tasks** you wish to simulate.

4.  **Configuration (Command Line):**
    * After the initial setup in the GUI, you must complete the parameter entry in the **MATLAB Command Window**.
    * The GUI will prompt you or the toolbox will wait for your input to specify the remaining task parameters (e.g., execution times, periods, deadlines) as required by the chosen scheduling algorithm.
    * *Follow the on-screen instructions that appear in the Command Window to finalize your simulation setup.*
